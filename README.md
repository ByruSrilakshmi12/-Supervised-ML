Prediction using Supervised ML(Level - Beginner)

Supervised learning is a process of providing input data as well as correct output data to the machine learning model. The aim of a supervised learning algorithm is to find a mapping function to map the input variable(x) with the output variable(y).

In the real-world, supervised learning can be used for Risk Assessment, Image classification, Fraud Detection, spam filtering, etc.

## How Supervised works 
In supervised learning, models are trained using labelled dataset, where the model learns about each type of data. Once the training process is completed, the model is tested on the basis of test data (a subset of the training set), and then it predicts the output.

## Steps Involved in Supervised Learning:

- First Determine the type of training dataset
- Collect/Gather the labelled training data.
- Split the training dataset into training dataset, test dataset, and validation dataset.
- Determine the input features of the training dataset, which should have enough knowledge so that the model can accurately predict the output.
- Determine the suitable algorithm for the model, such as support vector machine, decision tree, etc.
- Execute the algorithm on the training dataset. Sometimes we need validation sets as the control parameters, which are the subset of training datasets.
- Evaluate the accuracy of the model by providing the test set. If the model predicts the correct output, which means our model is accurate.

## Tpes of supervised ML

1. Regression

Regression algorithms are used if there is a relationship between the input variable and the output variable. It is used for the prediction of continuous variables, such as Weather forecasting, Market Trends, etc. Below are some popular Regression algorithms which come under supervised learning:

- Linear Regression
- Regression Trees
- Non-Linear Regression
- Bayesian Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression

2. Classification

Classification algorithms are used when the output variable is categorical, which means there are two classes such as Yes-No, Male-Female, True-false, etc.

Spam Filtering,

- Random Forest
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Support vector Machines

## Pros and Cons

- With the help of supervised learning, the model can predict the output on the basis of prior experiences.
- In supervised learning, we can have an exact idea about the classes of objects.
- This model helps us to solve various real-world problems such as fraud detection, spam filtering, etc.
- Supervised learning models are not suitable for handling the complex tasks.
- This cannot predict the correct output if the test data is different from the training dataset.
- Training required lots of computation times.
- In supervised learning, we need enough knowledge about the classes of object.
